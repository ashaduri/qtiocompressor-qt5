    	\section1 Description
	
	    QtIOCompressor is a QIODevice that compresses data streams.
	

	
	    The class works on top of a QIODevice subclass, compressing data before
            it is written and decompressing it when it is read. 

	    Since QtIOCompressor works on streams, it does not have to see
	    the entire data set before compressing or decompressing it. This
	    can reduce the memory requirements when working on large data sets.
